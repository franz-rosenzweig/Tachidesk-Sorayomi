## ⚠️ **Known Issues & Limitations**

### Development Environment
1. **Flutter DevTools Connection**: Occasional instability with hot reload during testing
   - **Impact**: Testing workflow, not app functionality
   - **Workaround**: Restart development session as needed
   - **Status**: Environment issue, not code issue

### Testing Infrastructure
1. **Server Dependency**: Full functional testing requires Tachidesk server setup
   - **Next Step**: Set up test server environment
   - **Alternative**: Unit test individual components

---

## 🎯 **Next Testing Phase**

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Functional Testing**: Test actual download/read workflows with real manga content
2. **Storage Testing**: Verify iOS Documents directory behavior
3. **Migration Testing**: Test storage migration with existing/mock data
4. **Performance Testing**: Memory usage and download speed validation

### Test Environment Setup:
1. **Tachidesk Server**: Set up local test server for manga sources
2. **Test Data**: Create sample manga and chapters for testing
3. **Storage Scenarios**: Test various storage conditions and migrations
